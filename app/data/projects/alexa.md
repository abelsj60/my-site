  "A third-generation Amazon Alexa Echo smartspeaker sits on a kitchen counter. A coffee mug is to its right, some cookbooks lean against a bowl of oranges to its left. The wall behind it is made of white tile. Two speech balloons hang above the speaker. The bubble to the left is pink, with a lighter pink man in the bottom right corner. He's saying the following: Alexa, please ping Washington Square. Alexa responds via the second speech bubble, which is white: Bored, huh? I'll ask Washington Square if anyone's around. Do you want to meet a boy or girl today?",
  "A second-generation Amazon Alexa Echo smartspeaker sits on a table. To its left is a stack of books with a pair of translucent cream sunglasses on top of them. A plant sits behind them in a stark white planter. To its left stands a lamp with a white shade and a tripod base made of light-colored wood. Two speech balloons hang above the speaker. The bubble to the left is pink, with a lighter pink man in the bottom right corner. He's saying the following: Alexa, open G's Rules of Funny. Alexa responds via the second speech bubble, which is white: O.K. From G's Rules of Funny, Twelve-year-olds are impressed when you flare your nostrils.", 
  "A second-generation Amazon Alexa Echo smartspeaker sits on a bedside table. The bed to its right has an upholstered grey headboard and navy sheets with an intermittent pattern of light-colored dashes. A white pillow rests against the headboard, on top of a navy one. A silver metal minimalist lamp stands to the left of the speaker on the bedside table. Two speech balloons hang above the speaker. The bubble to the right is pink, with a lighter pink man in the bottom right corner. He's saying the following: Alexa, take on G. Alexa responds via the second speech bubble, which is white: O.K. Let's play a game. What's the name of the rival band from the 1980s cartoon, Jem? a. The Misfits. b. The Jelly. c. The Jam. d. The Cretins."
